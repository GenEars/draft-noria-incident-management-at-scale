# Introduction

TODO Introduction

* Learning and sharing failure mode & remediation actions on complex systems towards improved worldwide system design and cross operator operational efficiency
* Leveraging reasoning capabilities and data sharing capabilities intrinsic to SemWeb KGs
* Need to consider both the infras-service-ecosystem while preserving privacy
* Need to align / keep compatible with in-production net configuration (e.g. Yang-based) & monitoring tools (e.g. CMDB and net discovery related tools) while opening to externaly maintained knowledge bases (e.g. CTI using UCO,

* providing a knowledge representation that is both human & computer friendly to overcome current limitations network design practices (e.g. many white papers from vendors) and incident response/management (e.g. proprietary knowledge bases on failure modes and risks, cross-organisations coordination)
* connecting to in-production configuration management databases (e.g. YANG-based deployment systems)
* providing both the technical perspective of networks and their ecosystem (e.g. asset location, organization, operations, etc.) to enable comprehensive network behavior analysis
* enabling privacy-preserving knowledge sharing of network designs and behavior models through entities's classes and types instead of sharing the knowledge graph itself.
